# React-Redux-Project
Simple React + Redux project made for  "Frontend development" course at University of Gdansk.
We can do CRUD operations  both  on episodes and characters ( in my case from Breaking Bad series).
Later on we can add characters to episodes in which they act in.

To run the project first we have to install json-server which is a fake rest api: npm install -g json-server
Then: npx json-server --watch db.json
Database works on http://localhost:3000/ 
To run react-app: npm start
The app works on http://localhost:5000/
